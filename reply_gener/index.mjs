// Other exports from this file (if any) would remain here.
// For example, if there were other functions or constants not moved, they'd be here.

// We need to check if any of the original imports are still needed by index.mjs itself
// or by other functions that might remain in index.mjs.
// Based on the provided content, all substantive logic (GetReply, getLongTimeLogAdder)
// and their direct dependencies were moved.
// So, this file might become primarily a re-export module for core functionalities.

// It's possible that some of the functions imported at the top of the original index.mjs
// (e.g., googlesearch, webbrowse, etc.) are actually exported from index.mjs for other modules to use.
// If that's the case, their imports and exports should be preserved here.
// For now, assuming GetReply and getLongTimeLogAdder were the main exports.

// Let's ensure any functions that *were* imported into the original index.mjs but *not* moved to core.mjs,
// and are potentially exported by index.mjs, are still handled.
// The initial file showed imports like:
// import { coderunner } from './functions/coderunner.mjs'
// ... and others from ./functions/
// These were used by GetReply. Since GetReply is now in core.mjs and core.mjs imports them directly,
// index.mjs itself no longer needs to import them *unless* it re-exports them.

// Let's assume for now that index.mjs was primarily for GetReply and getLongTimeLogAdder.
// If other files were importing specific function handlers (like coderunner) via index.mjs,
// those imports/exports would need to be preserved or updated.
// The subtask description implies index.mjs is a central point, so it might re-export.
// However, the main goal is fixing circular deps. The function handlers are now imported directly by core.mjs.

// The simplest form for index.mjs now is to re-export the core functions.
// Any other functions that were originally in index.mjs and NOT moved would remain here.
// But it seems there were none.
